# **ðŸ§  Brain Tumor MRI Classification (CS231: Introduction to CV)**

---
## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project delves into Brain Tumor MRI Classification, providing our initial foray into research-like endeavors. It aims to enhance skills in literature review, solution mapping, and applying techniques introduced in our course. We implement a standard Image Classification pipeline and explore creative, data-driven improvements by analyzing insights and errors. The project concludes by comparing our solutions to related work, drawing valuable conclusions, and identifying future work opportunities.

## Roadmap

1. **Literature Review and Solution Mapping**
   - Identify feasible topics and refine them to narrow scopes.
   - Conduct research to understand pipeline, techniques, and direction mapping.
      - Search some papers in the field or relation to have a general understanding of pipeline, techniques, and direction mapping.     

2. **Image Classification Pipeline**
   - **Image Pre-processing:** Resize, format channel form, and adjust pixel value range.
   - **Image Enhancement**
   - **Feature Extraction**
   - **Feature Reduction:** PCA
   - **Training Classifier Model**
   - **Evaluating Model**

3. **Insight and Error Diagnosis**
   - Propose novel methods and analyze reasons for proposals.

4. **Project Presentation and Documentation**
   - Design a formal PowerPoint presentation.
   - Record research process and results using Google Docs.
