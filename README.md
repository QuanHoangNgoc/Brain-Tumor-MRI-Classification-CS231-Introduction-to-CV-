# **🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Classification (CS231: Introduction to CV)**

---
## 🌟 Overview

This project delves into Brain Tumor MRI Classification, providing our initial foray into research-like endeavors. It aims to enhance skills in literature review, solution mapping, and applying techniques introduced in our course. We implement a standard Image Classification pipeline and explore creative, data-driven improvements by analyzing insights and errors. The project concludes by comparing our solutions to related work, drawing valuable conclusions, and identifying future work opportunities.
