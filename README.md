# **Brain Tumor MRI Classification (CS231: Introduction to CV)**

- This project focuses on investigating, considering, and evaluating comprehensive solutions for Brain Tumor MRI Classification, serving as our first experience in conducting a research-like project. 

- We undertook this work to hone our skills in the literature review, solution mapping, and applying popular techniques introduced in our course. We implement a standard Image Classification pipeline and explore creative, data-driven improvements by analyzing insights and errors. 

- Our efforts concluded in comparing our solutions with related work and drawing conclusions, along with identifying future work opportunities. The project provides valuable insights into both the challenges and innovations in the field.

## Used By

This project is used by the following users: 
- Students in university are learning and finding how to do the final research project. 
- Researchers are interested in Brain tumors or the Medical field. 
- A guidance for how to use and code with some CV frameworks and work with online GPU platforms.

## Roadmap

- **Literature review and solution mapping**: Find topics that are feasible and refine them to limit their scopes. Search some papers in the field or relation to have a general understanding of pipeline, techniques, and direction mapping. 

- **Image classification pipeline**: 
    - Image Pre-processing: resize, format channel form, and range value of pixel.
    - Image Enhancement 
    - Feature Extraction from Image 
    - Feature Reduction: PCA 
    - Training Classifier Model 
    - Evaluating Model 

- **Understand insight and error diagnosis**: propose a novel method and find reasons for the proposal. 

- **Show the project and record the research process**: design a formal and standard PowerPoint, and use Google Docs to record all documents, and result data when researching.  

## Tech Stack

**Process record**: Google Docs

**Show off**: PowerPoint presentation

**Topic finding for class course**: find driven-dataset > topic > problem. Use Jenni-AI and Google Search to find papers, and Gemini to explain them and recommend (link them) some trend or value directions. 

**Framework**: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, skimage, opencv, sklearn, keras, absl, etc. 

    Image: numpy
    Dataset Exploration and read, display image: pandas, plt, skimage, opencv
    Image operations: numpy, skimage
    Feature extraction: numpy, skimage, sklearn 
    Dataset split: sklearn->train_test_split 
    PCA: sklearn->pca  
    Training: sklearn, keras
    Evaluation: sklearn->cross_val, sklearn->mertrics 




## Lessons Learned

- The process for approaching a first research project.
- Image ML flow when doing the research project. 
- Proficiency in CV frameworks.
